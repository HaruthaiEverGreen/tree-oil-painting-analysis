Tree Oil Painting Analysis - Comparative Study with Van Gogh's "The Starry Night"

This repository contains the AI and scientific analysis results comparing The Tree Oil Painting with Vincent van Gogh's The Starry Night.

Included Materials:

X-ray imaging of The Tree Oil Painting

AI analysis using the 18 Supreme Techniques

Comparative AI analysis of The Starry Night

Original visual files for direct study


Key Points:

Brushstroke structure, torque mapping, pigment flow, and energy patterns were analyzed.

High consistency detected in torque flow, Fourier structure, and texture frequency spectrum.

Scientific imaging (X-ray Type I and II) indicates natural aging and brushstroke depth.


This dataset is part of the open research initiative Project Evergreen, aiming to allow independent verification by global AI and art researchers.
